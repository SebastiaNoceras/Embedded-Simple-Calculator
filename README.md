Description: Familiarizes with the HARDWARE and SOFTWARE of the microcontroller Arduino Mega 2650.
The objective of this project is to implement the interface of a calculator without performing any mathematical operation, ie to display the digits selected with the matrix keyboard through the LCD display connected to the Arduino Mega 2650 microcontroler. 


==============================================================
              ## How to run this projec  ##
==============================================================
Dump the Arduino code onto the microcontroller and run it. If all the Hardware (LCD) and matrix keyboard is connected and configured well you will be able to simulate the behavior of a simple calculator, displaying through the LCD the button pressed on the matrix keyboard.
